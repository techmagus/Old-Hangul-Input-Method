## About

The <span lang="phi-Hang">마부하미</span> <span lang="ko">한글</span> (<span lang="phi">Mabuhay</span> <span lang="ko-Latn">Hangeul</span>) is a project that started out as an experiment to adapt and adopt <span lang="ko">한글</span> (<span lang="ko-Latn">Hangeul</span>) as the writing system for native Philippine languages. <span lang="ko">한글</span> (<span lang="ko-Latn">Hangeul</span>) is a writing system that was scientifically developed by <span lang="ko">세종대왕</span> (<span lang="ko-Latn">Sejong the Great</span>) to make it easy for everyone to learn how to write phonetically.

The project was originally named <span lang="phi-Hang">삐ᄙᅵ삐너</span> <span lang="ko">한글</span> (<span lang="phi">Pilipino</span> <span lang="ko-Latn">Hangeul</span>), however, calling the project as <span lang="phi-Hang">마부하미</span> <span lang="ko">한글</span> (<span lang="phi">Mabuhay</span> <span lang="ko-Latn">Hangeul</span>) is more meaningful.

### <span lang="phi-Hang">마부하미</span> <span lang="ko">한글</span> (<span lang="phi">Mabuhay</span> <span lang="ko-Latn">Hangeul</span>)

The new name can mean the following:

* **Long live <span lang="ko">세종대왕</span> (<span lang="ko-Latn">Sejong the Great</span>)!** A great honour to a great king and teacher.
* **Welcome/Hello <span lang="ko">한글</span> (<span lang="ko-Latn">Hangeul</span>).** Welcoming the Korean writing script as an alternative to writing Philippine languages phonetically, aside from using the Latin script.
